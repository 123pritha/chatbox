In this project series we will create a Java Project which is Chatting Application with the help of Java Swing, AWT and Socket programming
<p>
  # Java Swing Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built using **Java Swing**, **AWT**, and **Socket.io** for real-time communication between users. The application supports multiple clients and includes a user-friendly graphical interface for chatting in real-time.

## About the Project

This chat application allows users to communicate with each other in real-time using socket-based communication. The GUI is developed using **Java Swing** and **AWT** to provide an intuitive interface for chatting, and **Socket.io** is used on the server-side to handle real-time communication.

The application consists of a **server** and **client** component:
- **Server**: Manages the communication between multiple clients.
- **Client**: Allows users to send and receive messages in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time communication**: Messages are sent and received instantly using sockets.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using Java Swing and AWT for a modern and easy-to-use interface.
- **Multiple Clients**: Supports multiple users connecting to the same server to chat.
- **Broadcast Messaging**: Messages sent by one client are broadcasted to all connected clients.
- **User Nicknames**: Each client is assigned a nickname for easy identification in the chat.
- **Basic Error Handling**: Manages connection errors and displays appropriate error messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: For building the GUI.
- **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: For additional GUI components and event handling.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time communication between clients and server.
- **Java Socket Programming**: For implementing the network communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the chat application locally, you will need:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (JDK 8 or later).
- A code editor such as **Netbeans IDE**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, or any text editor with Java support.
- Basic understanding of Java and socket programming.
